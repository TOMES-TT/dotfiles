# Dotfiles for Arch Linux

These are my dotfiles for Arch Linux. Any programs without configuration files in this repo are used with essentially default configs.

The idea here is pretty standard; get everything using the same font and the same color scheme, and do everything you can on the terminal, while maintaining a good workflow.

The color scheme is a variation on [raild](https://github.com/dkeg/crayolo/blob/master/colors/raild) by [dkeg](https://github.com/dkeg/); I've moved it to 16 colors and increased the contrast for greater usability. Maybe I made it better, maybe I mucked it up. Up to you to decide.

The color scheme is set using
